Bing Translate - Simple Ruby Client for Microsoft Translator API
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff512423.aspx

Before you can use the HTTP interface you must obtain a valid Bing API AppID.
You may obtain one by visiting http://www.bing.com/developers/appids.aspx

==Usage==

from_language = 'es'
to_language = 'en'
@bt = Bing::Translator.new(from_language, to_language, {:app_id => 'YOUR_APP_ID'})
puts @bt.translate('perro')


By default, the translator caches term translations in order to avoid unnecessary requests.
This can be globally disabled passing:
      :cache => false
in the options hash.

You can also skip the caching only for certain translation requests by passing
:cache => false to the translate method.

@bt.translate('A longer sentence that won't likely be repeated', { :cache => false })
